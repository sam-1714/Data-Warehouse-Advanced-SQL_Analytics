## 📖 Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a **Data Warehouse** and performing **Advanced SQL Analytics** using real-world CRM and ERP datasets.  
The objective was to integrate, cleanse, and analyze sales data (75K+ transactions) to derive actionable business insights using **MS SQL Server** and **Medallion Architecture** principles.

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1️⃣ Data Integration & ETL  
- Extracted raw data from **CRM** and **ERP** sources.  
- Applied **ETL pipelines** to cleanse and standardize 75K+ sales records.  
- Implemented data staging using **Bronze–Silver–Gold layers** (Medallion Architecture).  

### 2️⃣ Data Warehouse Design  
- Built a **Star Schema** data model with **Fact** and **Dimension** tables.  
- Ensured referential integrity and optimized indexing for analytical queries.  
- Designed schema for scalability and efficient querying.  

### 3️⃣ Advanced SQL Analytics  
Used **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and **Window Functions** for advanced reporting and insights:
- 📈 **Change Over Time Analysis** — growth and trend tracking.  
- 📊 **Cumulative Analysis** — running totals and aggregated performance.  
- 🧮 **Performance Analysis** — ranking and comparison across KPIs.  
- 🧩 **Part-to-Whole Analysis** — category contributions to totals.  
- 🎯 **Data Segmentation** — customer & product grouping for behavior insights.  
- 📑 **Customer and Product Reports** — summarized analytical dashboards in SQL.
